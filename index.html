        <h2 id="MachineLearning">Machine learning</h2>

            <ol>
                <li> Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves developing algorithms that learn patterns from presented data. Instead of coding in every imaginable detail of Chewbaca feed multiple presentations of Chewbaca (in the sun, fighting, different sizes, etc) to the algorithms which fill in an ever-expanding set of Chewbaca details: this is machine learning based on experience and exposure to data. Humans learn this way as well.
                </li>
                <li> Deep learning is a subset of Machine learning which uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems by performing ever more detailed dives into data to recognize patterns. This allows for the formulation of informed guesses about which movie, book, or restaurant, given your history of past choices you might like to try next.
                </li>
            </ol>
                
        <h3>Three types of learning</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Supervised learning means you have the data and you know what you want to achieve. Ex: extrapolate a price based on the amount of material used in a doll.</li>
                <li>Classification groups data into a class.</li>
                <li>Unsupervised machine learning works with unlabeled data and creates classes based on identified patterns.</li>
                <li>Reinforcement learning: learning to make decisions by interacting w/environment and using a reward/penalty system to guide decision making.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>There are 5 categories:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine emotion (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in a piece of text. By monitoring social media, can identify trends, react proactively to negative reviews, capitalize on positive reviews, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Text classification</li>
                <ul>

        <h2>ChatGPT and Prompt Engineering</h2>

        <p>Prompt engineering is an AI term. In addition to ChatGPT there is Google's Bard, Microsoft's Bing, etc. The 'T' in ChatGPT was developed by Google, and GPT = generative pre-training transformer. ChatGPT is also used by MSFT.<br>
        <br>
        To make prompts most effective:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Directional/Instructional prompting: be discriptive as possible (see Output format #2).</li>
            <li>Output format - Ex: List 5 programming languages focused on web development explaining primary purpose for each. Generate output with format: Programming language -> Utilization</li>
            <li>Role/System prompting - Ex: You are an urban planner who has created many smart cities. 1. Create presentation slides etc... 2. No more than 3 bullet points per slide, 3. Put motivational quote on smart cities on second slide.</li>
            <li>Few or zero-shot prompting is a technique that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform specific tasks. By providing a few examples, known as "shots," you can condition the model to generate desired outputs, be it text, code, or images.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Regression analysis is an attempt to define what's going to happen in the future by examining historical data.</li>
            <li>TPU (tensor processing unit) and GPU <a href="https://openmetal.io/docs/product-guides/private-cloud/tpu-vs-gpu-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank">definitions</a></li>
            <li>AutoML (automatic model learning) uses machine learning models to view data using varying criteria, leveraging concepts such as <u>hyper parameter optimization</u>.</li>
            <li>Transfer Learning: open source results</li>
            <li>Have ChatGPT ask <em>YOU</em> clarifying questions!</li>
